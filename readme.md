## Curated Content

This section is resered for links and articles I am particularly fond of.


## Using Foam

We've created a few Bubbles (markdown documents) to get you started.

- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorised later
- [[foam-tips]] - tips to get the most out of your Foam workspace
- [[todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[inbox]: inbox "Inbox"
[foam-tips]: foam-tips "Foam tips"
[todo]: todo "Todo"
